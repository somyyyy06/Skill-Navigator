ML SYSTEM OVERVIEW (WHAT YOU’RE BUILDING)

Your ML system has 4 independent but connected models:

ML Service (Python + FastAPI)
│
├── Model 1: Roadmap Recommendation
├── Model 2: Skill Level Classification
├── Model 3: Progress Speed Prediction
├── Model 4: Dropout Prediction (🔥 STAR)


Each model:

Solves a specific problem

Uses clear features

Produces actionable outputs

📌 This structure alone impresses examiners.

🧠 MODEL 1 — ROADMAP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
🎯 Problem

Users don’t know which roadmap to start.

📥 Input Features
Feature	Type
Current skill level	categorical
Goal (placement / higher studies)	categorical
Year of study	numeric
Preferred domain	categorical

Example:

{
  "skill_level": "beginner",
  "goal": "placements",
  "year": 4,
  "interest": "backend"
}

📤 Output
Recommended Roadmap: Backend Developer

🧠 Model Choice
Decision Tree Classifier

Why?

Easy to explain

Rule-based logic

Perfect for viva

📊 Dataset (Initial – You Create It)

You can manually create 100–300 rows.

skill	goal	year	interest	roadmap
beginner	placement	4	backend	Backend
intermediate	placement	3	frontend	Frontend

📌 Synthetic data is allowed in final-year projects.

🏋️ Training Logic
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)
joblib.dump(model, "recommender.pkl")

🧠 MODEL 2 — SKILL LEVEL CLASSIFICATION
🎯 Problem

System must adapt difficulty of explanations.

📥 Input Features
Feature
Avg time per step
No. of retries
Doubts asked
Completion speed
📤 Output
Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced

🧠 Model
Logistic Regression

Why?

Multiclass classification

Very explainable

📊 Dataset

Collected automatically from platform usage.

Example row:

{
  "avg_time": 45,
  "retries": 3,
  "doubts": 5,
  "label": "beginner"
}

🧠 MODEL 3 — PROGRESS SPEED PREDICTION
🎯 Problem

Predict how fast a user will complete a roadmap.

📥 Input Features
Feature
Daily active minutes
Steps completed
Days since enrollment
Streak length
📤 Output
Predicted days to completion

🧠 Model
Linear Regression

Why?

Numerical prediction

Simple + strong justification

💡 Usage

Slow learners → suggest lighter roadmap

Fast learners → advanced resources

🔥 MODEL 4 — DROPOUT PREDICTION SYSTEM (STAR FEATURE)

THIS is what sets your project apart.

🎯 Problem

Detect users likely to abandon a roadmap.

📥 Input Features (CRITICAL)
Feature	Meaning
days_inactive	inactivity
progress_speed	completion rate
doubt_frequency	confusion
missed_streaks	consistency loss

Example:

{
  "days_inactive": 5,
  "progress_speed": 0.3,
  "doubts": 8,
  "missed_streaks": 2
}

📤 Output
Dropout Risk: YES / NO

🧠 Model
Random Forest Classifier
(or Logistic Regression)

Why?

Handles mixed features

Robust

Easy explanation

🎯 Actions Triggered (IMPORTANT)

If YES:

Chatbot intervention

Recommend revision resources

Suggest lighter roadmap

📌 Closed-loop intelligence (very mature)

🧠 HOW YOU EXPLAIN THIS IN VIVA (SCRIPT)

“We designed multiple ML models to personalize learning.
A recommendation model suggests roadmaps, a classifier adapts difficulty, a regression model predicts progress speed, and a behavioral model predicts dropouts and triggers intelligent interventions.”

That answer alone = top marks.
