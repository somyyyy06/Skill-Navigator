Excellent — this is the brain + nervous system of your platform.
I’ll give you a production-grade chatbot design that examiners and interviewers both respect.

This answer has 4 solid parts:

1️⃣ What your chatbot actually is (clear positioning)
2️⃣ Prompt design (the MOST important part)
3️⃣ Backend flow (step-by-step, no confusion)
4️⃣ How this chatbot connects with AI/ML layers (magic but explainable)

1️⃣ WHAT YOUR CHATBOT REALLY IS (FREEZE THIS CONCEPT)

❌ Not:

“ChatGPT embedded in a website”

✅ Yes:

A context-aware AI mentor that understands the platform, the roadmap, and the user’s progress

That one sentence is how you should describe it everywhere.

2️⃣ CHATBOT ARCHITECTURE (HIGH LEVEL)
User → Chat UI
        ↓
Backend (Chat Controller)
        ↓
Context Builder
   (Roadmap + Progress + ML insights)
        ↓
LLM API
        ↓
Structured Response
        ↓
UI (Answer + Suggestions)


This is NOT RAG with vectors yet, but it’s final-year perfect.

3️⃣ CHATBOT PROMPT DESIGN (THIS IS GOLD)

This is where most projects fail. Yours won’t.

🔑 Core Rule

The LLM should ONLY answer using your platform data + user context.

🧠 SYSTEM PROMPT (STATIC)
You are an AI learning mentor for a structured roadmap-based learning platform.

Rules:
- Answer only using the provided roadmap and user progress.
- Be concise, beginner-friendly, and actionable.
- If the user is struggling, suggest easier explanations or revision.
- If a concept is outside the roadmap, politely redirect.


📌 Examiner keyword: controlled generation

📘 CONTEXT PROMPT (DYNAMIC)

This is built by your backend before every AI call.

Roadmap: Backend Developer

Current Step: Express Middleware
Completed Steps: Node.js Basics, Express Routing
Weak Topics: Async JavaScript
Daily Progress Speed: Slow

❓ USER QUESTION
User Question:
"Explain middleware in simple terms"

🧠 FINAL PROMPT SENT TO AI
SYSTEM:
You are an AI learning mentor for a roadmap platform.

CONTEXT:
Roadmap: Backend Developer
Current Step: Express Middleware
Weak Topics: Async JavaScript
Progress Speed: Slow

USER QUESTION:
Explain middleware in simple terms.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Explain using beginner-friendly analogy
- Suggest next roadmap step
- Recommend 1 free resource


📌 This prompt design alone can get you extra marks.

4️⃣ BACKEND FLOW (STEP-BY-STEP, REAL ENGINEERING)
📁 BACKEND STRUCTURE (CHATBOT)
backend/
├── controllers/
│   └── chatbot.controller.js
├── services/
│   ├── contextBuilder.js
│   ├── llm.service.js
│   └── ml.service.js
├── routes/
│   └── chatbot.routes.js

🔁 CHATBOT FLOW (IMPORTANT)
STEP 1️⃣ User sends message
POST /api/chat
{
  "message": "I am stuck in Express middleware"
}

STEP 2️⃣ Backend fetches user data
user = getUser(userId)
roadmap = getCurrentRoadmap(userId)
progress = getProgress(userId)

STEP 3️⃣ Fetch ML Insights (CRITICAL)

From ML service:

Skill level

Dropout risk

Weak topics

mlInsights = {
  skillLevel: "Beginner",
  dropoutRisk: "YES",
  weakTopics: ["Async JS"]
}

STEP 4️⃣ Context Builder (CORE LOGIC)
buildContext(user, roadmap, progress, mlInsights)


Generated context:

User is a beginner.
Currently struggling with async JS.
Dropout risk is high.

STEP 5️⃣ Call LLM API
const response = callLLM({
  systemPrompt,
  context,
  userQuestion
})

STEP 6️⃣ Post-process AI response

Add:

Suggested next step

Resource links

Friendly tone

STEP 7️⃣ Return to frontend
{
  "answer": "...",
  "suggestedStep": "Express Middleware",
  "resources": [
    "YouTube Playlist Link"
  ]
}

5️⃣ HOW CHATBOT CONNECTS WITH AI / ML LAYERS

This is the killer integration.

🔥 If Dropout Risk = YES

Chatbot says:

“Looks like you’ve been inactive. Want a simpler explanation or a lighter roadmap?”

🔥 If Skill Level = Beginner

Simpler explanation

Analogies

Slower pace

🔥 If Skill Level = Advanced

Short answer

Deeper explanation

Interview tips

📌 This is adaptive intelligence, not static chat.

6️⃣ CHATBOT UI FEATURES (EXAM-SAFE)

Floating chat icon

Markdown answers

Clickable resources

Suggested follow-up questions

Chat history (stored in DB)

7️⃣ CHATBOT DATA STORED (VERY IMPORTANT)
Chat Logs Schema
{
  userId,
  question,
  aiResponse,
  timestamp,
  roadmapId
}


Used for:

Analytics

ML training

Weak-topic detection

8️⃣ HOW YOU EXPLAIN THIS IN VIVA (SCRIPT)

Use this 👇

“Our chatbot is a context-aware AI mentor.
It dynamically injects roadmap data, user progress, and ML-based behavioral insights into the prompt, ensuring controlled and personalized responses.”

That answer = instant respect.
