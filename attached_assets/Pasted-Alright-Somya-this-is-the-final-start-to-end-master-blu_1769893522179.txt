Alright Somya — this is the final, start-to-end master blueprint.
If you follow this phase by phase, you will:

✅ Finish a strong final-year project

✅ Avoid over-engineering

✅ Be able to explain every line in viva

✅ Turn this into a placement + portfolio project

I’ll guide you exactly like a senior engineer mentoring you, not like a tutorial.

🚀 PROJECT YOU ARE BUILDING (FREEZE THIS)

Name (internal): AI-Powered Learning Roadmap Platform
Core Idea:
A structured learning platform that:

Provides curated roadmaps

Tracks daily progress

Uses AI + ML to mentor users

Predicts dropouts & intervenes intelligently

🟦 PHASE 0 — THINK LIKE AN ENGINEER (DO THIS FIRST)

⏱️ Time: 2–3 days

What you do

Write problem statement

Write system objectives

Draw architecture diagram

Freeze feature list (NO new ideas after this)

Output

Project proposal

Final-year approval ready

📌 DO NOT CODE YET

🟦 PHASE 1 — FRONTEND UI FOUNDATION

⏱️ Time: 1–2 weeks

Goal

Build exact UniDash-style dashboard UI.

What you build

Sidebar (Profile, Roadmaps, Progress, Chatbot)

Dashboard cards

Roadmap list page

Roadmap detail page

Enroll button (UI only)

Folder structure
frontend/
 ├── components/
 ├── pages/
 ├── store/
 ├── App.jsx

Key rule

👉 Hardcode all data

📌 Purpose:

Nail UX

Avoid backend distraction

🟦 PHASE 2 — ROADMAP & LEARNING FLOW

⏱️ Time: 1 week

Goal

Create structured learning experience.

What you add

Roadmap → steps → resources

Step completion checkbox

External YouTube/docs links

Data model (frontend)
Roadmap
 └── Steps
      └── Resources


📌 Still frontend-heavy
📌 This becomes demo-ready early

🟦 PHASE 3 — BACKEND + DATABASE CORE

⏱️ Time: 2 weeks

Goal

Make the system real & persistent.

Backend services
/auth
/roadmaps
/enrollment
/progress

Key schemas

User

{
  name,
  email,
  password,
  enrolledRoadmaps,
  streak
}


Enrollment

{
  userId,
  roadmapId,
  startDate,
  progressPercent
}


DailyProgress

{
  date,
  stepsCompleted,
  timeSpent
}


📌 Now progress is tracked daily

🟦 PHASE 4 — PROGRESS DASHBOARD & ANALYTICS

⏱️ Time: 1 week

Goal

Convert raw data → insights.

Dashboard shows

📈 Daily progress graph

🔥 Streak counter

⏱️ Avg time per step

❌ Drop-off points

Analytics APIs
/analytics/dau
/analytics/completion-rate
/analytics/dropoffs


📌 Use Recharts / Chart.js

🟦 PHASE 5 — CHATBOT (LLM INTEGRATION)

⏱️ Time: 1–1.5 weeks

Goal

Create context-aware AI mentor.

Backend flow

User sends message

Backend fetches:

Roadmap

Progress

ML insights

Context injected into prompt

LLM generates response

Why this matters

Not generic ChatGPT

Controlled, explainable AI

📌 This is your AI core

🟦 PHASE 6 — ML SERVICE (INTELLIGENCE LAYER)

⏱️ Time: 2 weeks

ML models you implement

1️⃣ Roadmap Recommendation
2️⃣ Skill Level Classification
3️⃣ Progress Speed Prediction
4️⃣ 🔥 Dropout Prediction

ML service
ml-service/
 ├── training/
 ├── inference/
 ├── models/
 └── main.py

Why separate ML service?

Clean architecture

Easy Docker deployment

Viva-friendly explanation

🟦 PHASE 7 — AI LAYER 4: BEHAVIORAL INTELLIGENCE (STAR)

⏱️ Time: 4–5 days

Goal

Predict who will quit before they quit.

Inputs

Days inactive

Progress speed

Doubt frequency

Missed streaks

Output
Dropout Risk → YES / NO

Actions

Chatbot intervention

Lighter roadmap

Revision resources

📌 This is research-level maturity

🟦 PHASE 8 — ANALYTICS & OBSERVABILITY

⏱️ Time: 3–4 days

What you add

Chatbot usage analytics

API logs

Error logs

User behavior metrics

Tools

Winston (logs)

PostgreSQL (analytics DB)

📌 Almost no final-year project does this.

🟦 PHASE 9 — DOCKER & DEPLOYMENT

⏱️ Time: 4–5 days

Dockerize

Frontend

Backend

ML service

Redis

docker-compose
frontend
backend
ml-service
redis
mongodb


📌 Easy demo
📌 Easy deployment
📌 Big plus in viva

🟦 PHASE 10 — TESTING, POLISH & REPORT

⏱️ Time: 1 week

Testing

API testing

ML inference testing

UI testing

Report chapters

Introduction

Literature Survey

System Architecture

AI & ML Models

Implementation

Results & Analysis

Conclusion

🎓 HOW YOU PRESENT THIS PROJECT

Say this confidently:

“We built an AI-powered learning platform that tracks user behavior, predicts dropout risk using ML, and uses a context-aware chatbot to guide learners.”

That sentence = top-tier project.

🧭 YOUR EXECUTION ORDER (IMPORTANT)

Follow this EXACTLY:
1️⃣ UI →
2️⃣ Roadmaps →
3️⃣ Backend →
4️⃣ Progress →
5️⃣ Chatbot →
6️⃣ ML →
7️⃣ Dropout →
8️⃣ Docker

Never jump phases.
